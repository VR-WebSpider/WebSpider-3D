"""
Moodboard → Chat composer sync.

Mirrors the set of currently-selected moodboard images (and images
belonging to selected groups) into ``scene.webspider_chat_pending_attachments``
so the agent automatically sees them as attachments when the next
message is sent. One-way: moodboard selection drives the composer,
not the other way around. Manually-added attachments (file picker,
screenshots, clipboard, blend-data) are left untouched — we only
own attachments whose ``is_moodboard`` flag is True.

**Why polling instead of a property update= callback:**
The moodboard's click / box-select / cmd-click operators are
implemented in C++ (``src/source/blender/editors/space_webspider_ai/
webspider_ai_moodboard_ops_*.cc``) and call ``RNA_property_boolean_set``
directly *without* a follow-up ``RNA_property_update``. Blender's
``update=`` callback machinery only fires from the latter path, so
a property-side callback misses every selection change made by the
operators users actually use. A tiny polling tick that diffs a
"selection signature" against the last-seen value is robust against
every code path that mutates selection (Python, C++, scripts) and
costs effectively nothing when nothing has changed.

**Undo note:**
Mutations to ``pending_attachments`` happen from a ``bpy.app.timers``
callback, not from an operator. Blender's undo stack is operator-
driven (operators with ``'UNDO'`` in ``bl_options`` capture state on
completion), so timer-driven mutations don't push their own undo
steps — they're transparently rolled back as part of whatever
operator-captured snapshot the user reverts to. We deliberately
don't wrap the mutations in an internal operator to keep the call
path simple.
