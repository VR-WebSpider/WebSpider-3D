"""
Onboarding persistence

Tracks which users (by email) have already completed or skipped the
onboarding tour. Stored as a JSON file in WebSpider 3D's user-data dir so
the flag survives Blender restarts and is per-machine, per-account.

The seen-list is the gate for whether the welcome card opens — a
user appears in this file once they've finished or explicitly
skipped the tour, and from then on they never see the tour again
on this machine. Different users on the same machine each see the
tour exactly once.
