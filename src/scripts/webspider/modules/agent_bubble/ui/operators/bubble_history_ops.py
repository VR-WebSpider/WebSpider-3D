"""Toggle the chat history pane open / closed.

Why a click-toggle and not a press-and-hold drag: Blender Python UI
buttons fire on RELEASE, not PRESS. By the time an operator's invoke
runs, the user has already let go of the mouse — there's no way to
intercept the press itself. So press-and-hold drag from a Python
button is genuinely impossible without a custom C++ button type
(major surgery on Blender's UI internals).

Sliders DO have native press-and-hold drag, but they always show
their numeric value in the bar — which the user explicitly rejected.

So: click toggles. Two states (collapsed / expanded). Reliable,
predictable, and what we ship.
