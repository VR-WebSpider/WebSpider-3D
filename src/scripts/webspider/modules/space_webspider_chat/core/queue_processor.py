"""
Event processor for handling SSE slot-based events.

All events use slot-based format with bubble_id containing declarative
UI slot updates (loader, content, ephemeral, todo, actions, images).

IMPORTANT: SSE events arrive on a background thread, but Blender UI
operations must happen on the main thread. This module provides queue
functions to safely transfer events to the main thread via timers.
