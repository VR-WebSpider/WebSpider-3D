# Contributing

WebSpider 3D is publishing the Blender-side client source first. External pull requests are not open for general contribution yet.

For questions, build help, and general discussion, the fastest channel is the **WebSpider 3D Discord**: https://discord.gg/YVqvkQx8rX. Use GitHub issues for the specific reports listed under "Before Opening An Issue" below.

## Current Contribution Status

- Public source: open
- Public issues: limited to source-availability, build, license, and security-process questions
- External pull requests: not accepted until WebSpider 3D publishes the CLA workflow
- Contributor agreement: CLA required before WebSpider 3D accepts substantial external contributions

Pull requests opened before the CLA process is published may be closed without review.

## Before Opening An Issue

Check whether the issue is about this public client repository.

Use this repository for:

- Client-side build problems
- Source availability questions
- License and notice questions
- Blender-side client behavior that can be reproduced from public source

Do not post:

- Security vulnerabilities or suspected secrets; follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
- WebSpider 3D account credentials, API keys, tokens, logs containing secrets, or private scene data
- Requests for WebSpider 3D backend source code

## Development Rules

Follow the same structure used by the repo:

- Put durable WebSpider 3D source changes under `src/`
- Put Python module code under `src/scripts/webspider/modules/`
- Put C/C++ Blender customizations under `src/source/blender/`
- Keep reusable logic in the relevant module or `common`
- Use the build scripts instead of building directly from generated `source/`
- Keep environment variables in `.env` locally and never commit `.env`

## License Requirements

Every new file must carry SPDX license metadata.

For source files, add an inline SPDX header. For binary assets or formats that cannot carry comments, add an entry to `REUSE.toml`.

### How SPDX Headers Get Added

Add the SPDX header to each new file yourself (see existing files for the
format). CI runs `reuse lint` on every PR and will fail the build if any file
lacks copyright or license information.

### Optional: Local Pre-Commit Hook

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

This runs the same `reuse` compliance check locally before each commit so you
catch missing headers early. It is purely a developer convenience and is not
required. Configured hooks live in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

### Manual Commands

```bash
# Full REUSE compliance check (same as CI)
reuse --no-multiprocessing lint
```

If `reuse lint` reports a file missing copyright or license info, add an SPDX
header to the top of the file (see existing files for the format) or record it
in `REUSE.toml`.
