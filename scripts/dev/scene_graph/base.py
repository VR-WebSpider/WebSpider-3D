"""RelationLayer contract.

A layer reads the shared NodeRegistry and emits relation triplets
[subject_idx, object_idx, relation_type], read as
"nodes[subject] <relation_type> nodes[object]". Relation-type ids are
layer-local (start at 1); each triplet is decoded against its own layer's
legend, so layers never collide in id space.
