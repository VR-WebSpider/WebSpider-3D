"""Project Rules — store format and first-message injection.

Rules live in ``scene.webspider_chat_rules`` (ui/properties/rules_props.py),
persist with the .webspider3d file, and are prepended ONLY to the wire message of
the send that opens a new session. The optimistic user bubble keeps the raw
prompt — rules never clutter the visible transcript.

Store format: a compact JSON list of ``{"text": str, "enabled": bool}``
entries — the rules overlay presents each entry as its own card with an
enable/disable toggle. A legacy plain-text value (pre-list builds) parses
as a single enabled rule; the first structural edit rewrites it as JSON.
Only ENABLED rules are concatenated onto the wire.
