Onboarding Card

Custom GPU-rendered popup that replaces ``invoke_props_dialog`` for
the onboarding flow. Each step (welcome, the five info cards, and
the completion screen) is painted by the same modal operator using
this package — only the copy and anchor change.

Public surface:

* :func:`compute_layout` — measure and position a card given a step.
* :func:`draw_card` — POST_PIXEL draw callback (region-relative).
* :func:`hit_test` — translate a window-space mouse event to a
  button id (``"primary"``, ``"skip"``, or ``None``).
