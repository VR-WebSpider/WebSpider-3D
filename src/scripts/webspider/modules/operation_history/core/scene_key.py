"""Persistent per-scene operation-history id.

The operation log is a property of the *scene*, not of any single chat session — a scene
outlives sessions, and the most valuable manual edits happen before the user ever talks to
the agent. We therefore key all capture + reads by a stable id stored on the scene
(``scene.webspider3d_op_history_id``, saved in the .blend), assigned lazily on first use.
Pure except for the lazy attribute assignment; no bpy import needed.
