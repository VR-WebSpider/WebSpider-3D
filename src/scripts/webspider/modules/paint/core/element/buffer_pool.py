"""Thread-safe buffer pooling for pixel operations.

This module provides a buffer pool to reduce memory allocation overhead during
repeated pixel operations. Buffers are reused across operations, significantly
reducing GC pressure and allocation time.

Buffer Pool Lifecycle
=====================
1. ACQUISITION: Call acquire_buffer(size, dtype) to get a buffer.
   - Returns a pooled buffer if available, otherwise allocates new.
   - The caller is responsible for the buffer until release.

2. USAGE: Use the buffer for pixel operations.
   - Buffer contents are undefined on acquisition (not zeroed).
   - Caller must initialize or overwrite all values.

3. RELEASE: Call release_buffer(buffer) when done.
   - Buffer is returned to pool for reuse.
   - Do NOT use the buffer after releasing.

4. CLEANUP: Call clear_buffer_pool() to free all pooled memory.
   - Call during idle periods or when memory is constrained.
   - Safe to call at any time; pool will rebuild as needed.

Thread Safety
=============
All pool operations are protected by a threading.Lock. Multiple threads
can safely acquire and release buffers concurrently.

Example Usage
=============
    from .buffer_pool import acquire_buffer, release_buffer, clear_buffer_pool

    # Acquire a buffer
    buf = acquire_buffer(1024 * 1024 * 4)
    try:
        image.pixels.foreach_get(buf)
        # ... process buf ...
        image.pixels.foreach_set(buf)
    finally:
        release_buffer(buf)

    # Clear pool when done with batch operations
    clear_buffer_pool()

Test Isolation
==============
For unit tests, call clear_buffer_pool() in setUp/tearDown to ensure test
isolation. The global state is thread-safe but shared across tests within
the same process.

    class TestPixelOps(unittest.TestCase):
        def setUp(self):
            clear_buffer_pool()  # Start with empty pool

        def tearDown(self):
            clear_buffer_pool()  # Clean up after test
