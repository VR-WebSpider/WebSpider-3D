"""Build the base PBR image layer and bind 5 maps into channels.

Replicates the proven binding sequence of ``LAYERS_OT_OpenImagesToLayer.execute``
(``ui/operators/layer_image_import_ops.py``) -- the canonical operator that binds a
full PBR map set into a single COLOR fill layer via the override system. This is bpy
runtime-only code; there is no pytest coverage and correctness is verified in a manual
Blender run.

Binding rules (see ``manifest.map_to_channel_binding``):
- basecolor -> "Color"             (sRGB,      regular override slot ``cache_image``)
- roughness -> "Roughness"         (Non-Color, regular override slot ``cache_image``)
- metallic  -> "Metallic"          (Non-Color, regular override slot ``cache_image``)
- ao        -> "Ambient Occlusion" (Non-Color, regular override slot ``cache_image``)
- normal    -> "Normal"            (Non-Color, normal slot ``cache_1_image`` / override_1)
- height    -> "Normal"            (Non-Color, regular override slot ``cache_image``, bump)

The Normal channel is shared by tangent-space normals (override_1 / ``source_1``) and
height/bump (regular override / ``source``); the ``normal_map_type`` chosen at layer
creation selects the mode (NORMAL_MAP / BUMP_MAP / BUMP_NORMAL_MAP).

    Mirrors ``LAYERS_OT_OpenImagesToLayer.execute``: a two-phase bind where cache
    nodes are created under ``mp.halt_update = True`` (phase 1) and the override
    flags are set with ``halt_update`` restored (phase 2), which triggers the
    callback that migrates cache -> source and wires the nodes.

    Args:
        manifest_layer: The index-0 PBR layer dict from the build manifest. Expects a
            ``maps`` dict keyed by ``basecolor/roughness/metallic/ao/normal/height``
            with download URLs, and an optional ``name``.
        obj: Optional object whose active material holds the WebSpider 3D paint node. When
            None the active object is used (the operator's default behaviour).
            IMPORTANT: the layer is created on whichever object is *active* in the
            scene (``add_new_layer`` resolves it via ``get_active_object()`` and
            ignores ``obj``). Pass ``obj=None`` or ensure ``obj`` is the active
            object, otherwise the node is read from one object and the layer built
            on another.

    Returns:
        The newly created layer, or None if no active WebSpider 3D node was found.
