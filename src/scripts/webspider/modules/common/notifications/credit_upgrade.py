Credit-Upgrade Notification

The backend pushes a ``credit_upgrade`` notification (via ``notifications.push``)
when a user's credits are exhausted. The client renders a sticky toast with an
"Upgrade" button wired to ``webspider3d.open_credit_upgrade``, which opens the
manage-subscription page in the browser via the seamless auth handoff.

Mirrors the ``update`` type's pattern: a distinct type the client recognises
and turns into a toast whose action button targets a client-side operator, so
the backend never needs to know operator idnames.
