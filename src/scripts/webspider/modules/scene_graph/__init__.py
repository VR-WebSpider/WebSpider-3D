"""scene_graph module.

A per-scene, agent-readable scene graph. Currently emits the Outliner hierarchy
(ObjectGraph): nodes = every object, edges = parent_of. Spatial / semantic
layers are added on top of the same nodes later.

The graph is built lazily (rebuilt on the next query after the scene changes)
and stored per-scene on a SKIP_SAVE Scene property. Agents traverse it via
core.tools.run_tool(scene, name, params).
