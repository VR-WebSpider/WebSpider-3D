"""Prune the agent render cache — a native (unsandboxed) helper the sandboxed
render scripts call to cap how many temp render PNGs accumulate.

Why this exists: the ScriptExecutor sandbox no longer exposes ``os`` (injecting
the real module was a sandbox escape, so it was removed). The agent's
``render_viewport`` / ``render_multiview`` scripts therefore write their PNGs to
the OS temp dir but can no longer ``os.listdir`` / ``os.unlink`` to enforce a
retention cap. This operator runs as ordinary addon code with full ``os`` access
and does that pruning, invoked from the sandboxed script via::

    bpy.ops.webspider_ai_chat.prune_render_cache(keep=200)

Scope is deliberately narrow: it only touches files in the system temp dir whose
names match the agent render prefixes, and it never raises — pruning is
best-effort cleanup that must never break a render (the OS temp reaper remains
the ultimate backstop). Callers wrap the invocation in try/except, so an older
client without this operator still renders fine, just uncapped.
