"""Open the Agent Bubble in a small chrome-less Blender TEMP window.

Thin wrapper around the C++ operator WEBSPIDER_OT_agent_bubble_show_window
(registered in src/source/blender/editors/space_agent_bubble/
space_agent_bubble.cc), which calls WM_window_open_temp — the same
code path Blender uses for the Preferences / Drivers Editor / Info
Log popups.

The wrapper exists because:
  1. The Window menu hook (in agent_bubble_module.py bootstrap) is
     wired to webspider3d.agent_bubble_open_window. Keeping the Python
     idname stable lets us avoid touching the menu hook every time we
     swap implementations.
  2. Earlier revisions tried wm.window_new_main + workspace.duplicate
     + screen.area_close from Python, all of which produce a full main
     window (with topbar + workspace tabs + statusbar) that visually
     reads as 'a second WebSpider 3D instance'. WM_window_open_temp instead
     produces a dedicated single-area window with no chrome — matching
     the original popup intent.
