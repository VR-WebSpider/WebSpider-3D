"""Image Gen Tab Drawer — catalog mode selector.

The Image Gen tab consolidates the ``image_gen`` capability's moodboard
services behind a Mode dropdown (the paint-surfaced ``brush_gen`` is
filtered out by the catalog cache's surface filter). Called from
``sidebar_panel_drawers._draw_imagegen``:

- Text to Image keeps the existing Image Gen UI + ``webspider_ai.imagegen_generate``
  flow unchanged.
- When the catalog places ``depth_to_image`` under this capability, its
  From Blockout mode renders via the shared ``blockout_drawer`` (the
  same service normally lives under the AI Render tab — which tab hosts
  it is a DB-only ``capability_id`` decision).

When the catalog isn't loaded (offline / pre-auth) the Mode dropdown is
not drawn and the tab falls back to the Text to Image-only UI.
