"""Window-level UI mode operators.

Two operators that flip WebSpider 3D between Zen mode (minimal viewport +
Agent Bubble + moodboard, no Engine workspace tabs) and Engine mode
(all workspaces, full Blender-style UI). The choice persists in
webspider.json so the next launch boots into the same mode.

The internal idents stay UI_MODE_AI / webspider3d.set_ui_mode_ai for backward
compatibility with persisted webspider.json values; the user-visible labels
have evolved from "AI Mode" → "Basic Mode" → "Zen Mode" (and
correspondingly "Pro Mode" → "Engine Mode") without breaking saved
config files.
