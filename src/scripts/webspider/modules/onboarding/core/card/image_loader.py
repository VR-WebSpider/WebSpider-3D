"""
Onboarding Card — Image Loader

Lazily loads image assets from ``onboarding/assets/`` into Blender's
``bpy.data.images`` and turns them into ``gpu.types.GPUTexture``
objects we can sample from a draw callback.

Caching: per-path, both the ``bpy.data.images`` entry and the
``GPUTexture`` are cached for the session. ``draw_image_textured``
draws a quad with the cached texture.

Failures (missing file, image load error, GPU texture creation
fail) are logged once at WARNING and then silenced — the renderer
falls back to skipping the image.
