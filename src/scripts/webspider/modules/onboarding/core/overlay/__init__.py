"""
Onboarding Background Dim

A single GPU draw handler that paints a semi-transparent black
"film" over the 3D viewport / WEBSPIDER_AI space whenever the user is
somewhere in the onboarding flow. Its only job is to make the
floating native dialogs (welcome, tour steps, completion picker,
what's-next picker) stand out from the editor behind them.

Nothing fancy — no spotlight, no tooltip, no hit-testing. The
dialogs handle all click logic themselves.
