"""From Blockout (``depth_to_image``) mode UI — shared drawer.

The ``depth_to_image`` service renders under whichever moodboard tab the
generation catalog places it: historically the Image Gen tab's "From
Blockout" mode, now the AI Render tab (capability ``ai_render``). Moving
it between tabs is a DB-only change (repoint the service's
``capability_id``), so the drawing logic lives here — OUTSIDE any one
tab's drawer — and both ``image_gen_drawer`` and ``ai_render_drawer``
call it. Never fold this back into a single tab's drawer, or the DB
move stops being reversible without a client release.

The viewport depth capture and queue submission are the EXISTING flow
(``webspider_ai.lookdev_generate`` → ``lookdev_generate_from_scene``,
FEATURE_LOOKDEV queue); inputs live on ``tab_lookdev`` (prompt,
fast_mode) because the submit operator reads them from there.
