AST transforms that make agent-generated bpy scripts crash-safe.

Unlike ``sandbox_validator`` (which *rejects* unsafe scripts), these transforms
silently rewrite a script into an equivalent-but-safe form before compilation.

The one transform here — :func:`snapshot_collection_iterations` — defends against
a hard, uncatchable Blender crash: mutating a live ``bpy`` collection while
iterating it.

    for obj in bpy.context.scene.collection.all_objects:
        bpy.data.objects.remove(obj)          # <-- frees the array the C-level
                                              #     iterator is walking -> segfault

``collection.all_objects`` / ``collection.objects`` / ``bpy.data.objects`` are
live RNA collections backed by a C ``ListBase`` cache. Adding or removing an
object (``.remove``/``.link``/``.unlink``, ``bpy.ops.object.delete``/``join``,
any ``*_add`` operator, ...) invalidates and frees that cache. Because the
Python ``for`` loop holds a raw pointer into it, the *next* iteration reads freed
memory and Blender dies with a native segfault in ``Collection_all_objects_next``
— which no ``try/except`` in the executor can catch, taking the user's unsaved
work with it.

The same mechanism is not specific to objects: any live RNA collection whose
elements the loop body removes (``node_tree.nodes``/``.links`` clears in
material scripts, ``bpy.data.materials``/``.images`` cleanup sweeps,
``bpy.data.scenes``/``.collections`` lane teardown, modifier/constraint stack
removal) reads freed memory the same way. ``_LIVE_COLLECTION_ATTRS`` below
lists the covered attributes.

Wrapping the iterable in ``list(...)`` drains the collection into a plain Python
list up front, so the loop walks Python references instead of the live C array.
Any mutation inside the body is then safe. This is body-agnostic: it fixes the
crash no matter *how* the loop mutates, without having to enumerate every
mutating call. ``list(coll.all_objects)`` is semantically identical for the
common (read-only) case and matches the author's intent in the mutating case.

Coverage — this handles the two dominant idioms, both purely syntactically (no
dataflow analysis, which aliasing/reassignment would make unreliable):

    for obj in bpy.data.objects: ...              # inline attribute iterable
    objs = coll.all_objects
    for obj in objs: ...                          # bound then *immediately* iterated

It does NOT catch a live collection bound to a variable and iterated later with
other statements in between (``objs = coll.all_objects; print(...); for o in
objs:``) — that still segfaults if mutated. The backend prompt guidance
(``execute_bpy_script`` docstring) steers the model away from those forms; this
transform is the in-plugin safety net for the common shapes.

# Attribute names that resolve to a LIVE bpy RNA collection whose backing array
# is freed on membership change. Iterating one of these directly (not via
# ``list(...)``) and mutating inside the loop segfaults Blender.
#
# Beyond the original ``.objects``/``.all_objects`` crash, the same
# mechanism (C iterator holding a pointer into a ListBase/Main-backed array
# freed by ``.remove()``/``.unlink()``/an operator inside the body) applies to
# the collections agent texturing and scene-lane scripts routinely clear in a
# loop: ``node_tree.nodes``/``.links`` ("clear the node tree"), ``bpy.data
# .materials``/``.images``/``.meshes`` (cleanup sweeps), ``bpy.data
# .collections``/``.scenes``/``collection.children`` (lane teardown), and the
# per-object stacks (``modifiers``, ``constraints``, ``vertex_groups``,
# ``uv_layers``, ``edit_bones``).
#
# Deliberate exclusions:
# - ``selected_objects`` — returns a fresh Python list per access, already safe.
# - High-cardinality mesh data (``vertices``, ``edges``, ``loops``,
#   ``polygons``) — not element-removable mid-loop through these handles, and a
#   ``list(...)`` snapshot of a million-element array per loop would be a real
#   performance regression on exactly the heavy scripts this guards.
