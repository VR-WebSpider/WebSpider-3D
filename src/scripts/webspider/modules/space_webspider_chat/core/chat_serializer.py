"""
Generic PropertyGroup <-> dict serialization for chat messages.

Extracted from ``ui/operators/export_ops.py`` so the same deep
snapshot/restore machinery can be shared by:

  * the "Export .blend without chat history" operator (strip + restore),
  * the local chat-history archive (``core/chat_history.py``), which
    persists whole sessions as JSON under ``~/.webspider3d/chat_history/``.

Everything here is deliberately bpy-free at import time: the functions
only touch the PropertyGroup instances passed in, so the module can be
imported in isolated tests.
