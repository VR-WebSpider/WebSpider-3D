flow is purely informational — five short cards that explain

retopology, WebSpider Chat) bracketed by a welcome and a completion
screen. No prompt pre-fills, no pollers, no auto-action.

# proximity-positioning unreliable across DPI scales. We render the

# feedback, and per-step layout (centre / sidebar-adjacent / above
