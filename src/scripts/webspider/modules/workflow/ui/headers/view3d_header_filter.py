"""3D viewport header & tool-panel filter for the dual-mode UI system.

Monkey-patches:
- VIEW3D_HT_header.draw         → renders only the shading-mode buttons
                                   (wireframe/solid/material/rendered + popover)
                                   when the viewport is in the Zen Mode workspace.
- VIEW3D_HT_tool_header.draw    → renders nothing in Zen mode (empty strip).

The left T-panel (VIEW3D_PT_tools_active) is intentionally LEFT ALONE —
Zen Mode keeps the standard tool icons so users can still grab brush /
sculpt / select tools. Earlier builds emptied the T-panel as part of the
"calm canvas" look but losing tool access made Zen Mode useless for
anything beyond viewing.

We patch the contents instead of hiding the regions because hiding regions
gives Blender's collapsed-region arrow that lets the user expand them again
— that defeats the "calm canvas" goal of Zen mode.

Mode check uses context.workspace.name, not the global ui_mode preference.
This is workspace-driven so the right rendering happens regardless of which
window is active or whether a workspace switch is mid-flight, and so the
"AI Mode" workspace tab in Engine mode renders as a regular Pro workspace
(filter does NOT apply there — only the dedicated Zen Mode workspace).
