"""Transient viewport toast confirming a generation entered the queue.

Users routinely miss the agent's chat text saying a generation was queued,
so every ``FeatureQueue.submit()`` also raises a small auto-fading toast in
the viewport's top-right corner with a "View Queue" action.

Burst aggregation: agent scripts and multi-mesh fan-outs enqueue jobs one
at a time, sometimes seconds apart. The toast id is stable and the store's
``push()`` replaces an existing item with the same id AND restarts its TTL,
so while jobs keep arriving one toast stays on screen and its count climbs
("3 generations queued"). A burst ends once no job has been queued for a
full toast lifetime; the next enqueue then starts a fresh count. A manual
dismiss mid-burst is intentionally NOT a reset — the next job re-shows the
toast with the cumulative burst count, which is still the truthful number.
