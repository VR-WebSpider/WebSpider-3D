"""Spatial scene graph generator (standalone).

Run this inside the WebSpider 3D / Blender Python console or as a script to produce an
agent-readable JSON graph describing the *spatial* relationships between the
mesh objects in the current scene.

Encoding (inspired by CAD-Refiner's topological structure graph):
  - nodes      : a flat, index-stable list. Each node is its id + compact
                 geometry (centroid `c`, dimensions `d`).
  - relations  : integer triplets [subject_idx, object_idx, relation_type],
                 read as "nodes[subject] <relation_type> nodes[object]".
  - a `relation_types` legend maps the integer ids to names.

This keeps every relationship ~9 bytes instead of a verbose JSON object, so the
graph stays small even in busy scenes. Continuous proximity (gaps/distances) is
NOT stored -- "nearness" is implied by a directional relation existing, since we
only relate object pairs that fall within a near band.

Relationships captured, all in the WORLD reference frame:
  - support   : "on top of", from vertical contact + horizontal footprint overlap
  - direction : left/right, front/back, above/below between near objects

Geometry precision: each object is reduced to its ORIENTED bounding box, taken
from the *evaluated* mesh (modifiers applied) so the boxes reflect what is
actually in the viewport. The world-axis AABB enclosing that oriented box is the
primitive used for all spatial math.

Output: JSON saved to disk + a short human-readable summary printed to console.
